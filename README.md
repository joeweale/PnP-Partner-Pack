PnP Partner Pack can be considered as Starter Kit for customers and partners and combines numerous patterns and practices demonstrated in the [PnP samples](http://dev.office.com/patterns-and-practices-resources) to one reusable solution, which can be deployed and used in any Office 365 tenant. PnP Partner Pack is using [PnP SharePoint Core Component](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-sites-core), which increases developer productivity with CSOM and REST based operations.

# What's included? #

- PnP guidance and samples are maintained by Microsoft & community
- PnP uses supported and recommended techniques
- PnP implementations are reviewed and approved by Microsoft engineering
- PnP is open source initiative
- PnP is NOT a product and therefore it’s not supported through Premier Support or other official support channels
- PnP is supported in similar ways as other open source projects done by Microsoft with support from the community by the community
- There are numerous partners that utilize PnP within their solutions for customers. Support for this is provided by the Partner. When PnP material is used in deployments, we recommend to be clear with your customer / deployment owner on the support model.


# Can I use code and patterns from this solution? #
Yes. You can use this code and patterns anyway you want in your own implementations or offerings. You do not have to ask specific permission for anything around the PnP initiative. We rather hope that customers and partners would re-use our material as much as possible.

Obviously we are interested on your feedback and since PnP is open source community driven initiate, all contributions back to the PnP are absolutely welcome and appreciated, but not required.
